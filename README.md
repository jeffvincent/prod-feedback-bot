# Feedback Friend
_capturing your product feedbacks_

🎏 Remixed from [https://glitch.com/~slack-slash-command-and-dialogs-blueprint](https://glitch.com/~slack-slash-command-and-dialogs-blueprint)

## What's this app now?

This is a Slack app that creates Trello cards from dialog submissions in Slack. 

Specifically, here's what it does:
* Displays a [dialog](https://api.slack.com/dialogs) when a person in your Slack organization enters a particular [slash command](https://api.slack.com/slash-commands).
* Takes the data submitted to that dialog, and [creates a Trello card](https://trello.readme.io/v1.0/reference#cards-2) with it.

We use this to make it easy for our teammates to submit product feedback internally at Appcues. But you can use it for _anything_ – so long as that thing involves displaying a dialog in Slack, and creating Trello cards from it.
